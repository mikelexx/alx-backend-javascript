**SPIES**
- they don't modify behavour of functions, they simply spie on them
- to observe things like how they are called, with what arguments
**STUBS**
- a spy with extra behaviour
- used to replace only the behavour of a function
-used when all you want is to replace the behavour of a function without
carying if or how it was alled
**MOCKS**
- like stubs but with extra behavour
- like verifying how method was called, how many times
with what arguments ... (GENERARY verifying the interactions with object)
